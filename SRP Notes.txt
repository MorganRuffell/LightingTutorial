Scriptable Render Pipeline

What is the SRP?

-	The SRP is unity latest rendering solution that allows config of unitys rendering via C#
-	Out of the box it offers two templated solutions HDRP, URP.
-	Offers more control that the built in solution.
-	Some built in features are still in devlopment, these are minimal but they are still in development.

# HDRP

-	The high default rendering solution that is offered by Unity.
-	While in theory tou can build your game for any platform using this pipeline you would use this

# URP

URP or LWRP, is an alternate rednering solution that is geared towards compatibility and performance.
While many features are still avaliable in this pipleine their implemenations may differ to ofavour performance.
We can still use this for pretty things but primarily for lower end devices.

In URP you cannot have point lights that are realtime and reflective, and for this you'll have to use HDRP.

Area lights are emitted from a plane duh, there is some difference between point lights and area lights.
Screen space reflections in URP are not supported and HDRP they are supported.
Auto Exposure is not supported in URP and HDRP. 

Light cookies allow you to apply a texture to light, so that it has alpha interpolation. 

Ray Tracing light per object limits.

Remember to generate lightmap UVs enabled, unless the artists have manually created it themselves.

HDRP + DXR is Raytracing!

# HDRP Standard Shader

The mask map disorts the mesh per vertex.


## Occulusion Culling

LOD
	-	LODs are critical when optimising scene geometry. It generates different meshes at different levels of detail.
	-	You can generate this LODs in Maya
	- 	You can use UE4 auto LOD system to generate game ready LODs then export back to unity.

Mip Maps
	-	Texture Streaming, the LODs of the texture world.
	-	Consumes a small amount of CPU.
	- 	Edit -> Project Settings -> Quality -> Per Quality option. You can pick these settings in texture streaming.

Dynamic Resolution

	-	New Technology that is emerging and was pioneered by nintendo with BOTW.
	-	Avaliable on the camera
